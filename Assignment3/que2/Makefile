#### The second block defines "target - prerequisities - recipe" combinations
#### The syntax is as below:
# target : prerequisities
#	recipe      (there must be a tab before the recipe)

# default target is all
default: all

all: ${OBJS} 
	@echo "Building..."
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${INCLUDES} ${LIBS} $^ -o execfile

# Shorthand for lines 20--25; 
%.o: %.c
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c $< ${INCLUDES}

functions.o: functions.c convective_scheme_coeffs.h
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c $< ${INCLUDES}

#### End the block of targets ####################

#### The last block are phony targets ##################
# targets not associated with files, but only recipes
list:
	@echo $(shell ls)

clean:
	@echo "Cleaning..."
	${RM} *.o
	${RM} execfile
